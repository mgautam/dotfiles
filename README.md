## Installation

1. Clone into your home directory:

  ```bash
  git clone --recursive http://github.com/mgautam/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  ```

2. Read `~/.dotfiles/install.sh` and make sure you understand what it is going to
   do because it will override existing dotfiles.
3. Run the install script:

  ```bash
  ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
  ```
